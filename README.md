# gh-pr-review

`gh-pr-review` is a GitHub CLI extension that adds **inline PR review comments** and **thread inspection** to the terminal. This is a fork of [agynio/gh-pr-review](https://github.com/agynio/gh-pr-review) with additional features.  
GitHub’s built-in `gh` tool does *not* show inline comments, review threads, or thread grouping — but this extension does.

With `gh-pr-review`, you can:

- View complete **inline review threads** with file and line context  
- See **unresolved comments** during code review  
- Reply to inline comments directly from the terminal  
- Resolve review threads programmatically  
- Group and inspect threads with the `threads view` subcommand  
- Export structured output ideal for **LLMs and automated PR review agents**

Designed for developers, DevOps teams, and AI systems that need **full pull request review context**, not just top-level comments.

## Quickstart

The quickest path from opening a pending review to resolving threads:

1. **Install or upgrade the extension.**

   ```sh
   gh extension install v2nic/gh-pr-review
   # Update an existing installation
   gh extension upgrade v2nic/gh-pr-review
   ```


2. **Start a pending review.** Capture the returned `id`. When run inside a git repository, `-R owner/repo` and the PR number
   are inferred automatically from the git remote and current branch.

   ```sh
   # Explicit (works anywhere)
   gh pr-review review --start -R owner/repo 42

   # Inferred (inside a repo, on a branch with an open PR)
   gh pr-review review --start

   {
     "id": "PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12",
     "state": "PENDING"
   }
   ```

   Pending reviews omit `submitted_at`; the field appears after submission.

3. **Add inline comments with the pending review ID.** The `review
   --add-comment` command requires a `PRR_…` review node ID.

   ```sh
   gh pr-review review --add-comment \
     --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --path internal/service.go \
     --line 42 \
     --body "nit: use helper" \
     -R owner/repo 42
   ```

   You can also read the body from a file with `--body-file`:

   ```sh
   gh pr-review review --add-comment \
     --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --path internal/service.go \
     --line 42 \
     --body-file comment.md \
     -R owner/repo 42
   ```

   Or pipe content directly from stdin:

   ```sh
   echo "nit: use helper" | gh pr-review review --add-comment \
     --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --path internal/service.go \
     --line 42 \
     --body-file - \
     -R owner/repo 42
   ```

   {
     "id": "PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12",
     "path": "internal/service.go",
     "is_outdated": false,
     "line": 42
   }```

   **Edit comments before submission (optional).** Use `--edit-comment` with
   a comment node ID (`PRRC_…`) and new `--body` to update a comment:

   ```sh
   gh pr-review review --edit-comment \
     --comment-id PRRC_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --body "Updated: use helper function here" \
     -R owner/repo 42

   {
     "status": "Comment updated successfully"
   }
   ```

4. **Inspect review threads.** `review view` surfaces pending review
   summaries, thread state, and inline comment metadata. Thread IDs are
   always included; enable `--include-comment-node-id` when you also need the
   individual comment node identifiers.

   ```sh
   gh pr-review review view --reviewer octocat -R owner/repo 42

   {
     "reviews": [
       {
         "id": "PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12",
         "state": "COMMENTED",
         "author_login": "octocat",
         "comments": [
           {
             "thread_id": "PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12",
             "path": "internal/service.go",
             "author_login": "octocat",
             "body": "nit: prefer helper",
             "created_at": "2024-05-25T18:21:37Z",
             "is_resolved": false,
             "is_outdated": false,
             "thread_comments": []
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Use the `thread_id` values with `comments reply` to continue discussions. If
   you are replying inside your own pending review, pass the associated
   `PRR_…` identifier with `--review-id`.

   ```sh
   gh pr-review comments reply \
     --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --body "Follow-up addressed in commit abc123" \
     -R owner/repo 42
   ```

5. **Submit the review.** Reuse the pending review `PRR_…` identifier when
   finalizing. Successful submissions emit a status-only payload.

   ```sh
   gh pr-review review --submit \
     --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
     --event REQUEST_CHANGES \
     --body "Please add tests" \
     -R owner/repo 42

   {
     "status": "Review submitted successfully"
   }
   ```

   On errors, the command exits non-zero after emitting:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "Review submission failed",
     "errors": [
       { "message": "mutation failed", "path": ["mutation", "submitPullRequestReview"] }
     ]
   }
   ```

6. **Inspect and resolve threads.** Array responses are always `[]` when no
   threads match.

   ```sh
   gh pr-review threads list --unresolved --mine -R owner/repo 42

   [
     {
       "threadId": "R_ywDoABC123",
       "isResolved": false,
       "path": "internal/service.go",
       "line": 42,
       "isOutdated": false
     }
   ]
   ```

   ```sh
   gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id R_ywDoABC123 -R owner/repo 42
   
   {
     "thread_node_id": "R_ywDoABC123",
     "is_resolved": true
   }
   ```

## Review view

`gh pr-review review view` emits a snapshot of pull request discussion. The response groups reviews → parent inline comments → thread
replies, omitting optional fields entirely instead of returning `null`.

Run it with either a combined selector or explicit flags. When inside a git
repository, `-R` and `--pr` are inferred automatically:

```sh
# Explicit
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3

# Inferred (inside the repo, on a branch with an open PR)
gh pr-review review view
```

Install or upgrade the extension:

```sh
gh extension install v2nic/gh-pr-review
# Update an existing installation
gh extension upgrade v2nic/gh-pr-review
```

### Command behavior

- Single operation per invocation.
- Includes all reviewers, review states, and threads by default.
- Replies are sorted by `created_at` ascending.
- Output exposes `author_login` only—no user objects or `html_url` fields.
- Optional fields (`body`, `submitted_at`, `line`) are omitted when empty.
- `comments` is omitted entirely when a review has no inline comments.
- `thread_comments` is required for every inline comment and always present
  (empty arrays indicate no replies).

For the full canonical response structure, see docs/SCHEMAS.md.

### Filters

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--reviewer <login>` | Only include reviews authored by `<login>` (case-insensitive). |
| `--states <list>` | Comma-separated review states (`APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, `DISMISSED`). |
| `--unresolved` | Keep only unresolved threads. |
| `--not_outdated` | Exclude threads marked as outdated. |
| `--tail <n>` | Retain only the last `n` replies per thread (0 = all). The parent inline comment is always kept; only replies are trimmed. |
| `--include-comment-node-id` | Add comment node identifiers to parent comments and replies. |

Commands that accept `--body` also support `--body-file <path>` to read body
text from a file. Use `--body-file -` to read from stdin. The two flags are
mutually exclusive.

### Examples

```sh
# Default: return all reviews, states, threads
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3

# Unresolved threads only
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3 --unresolved

# Focus changes requested from a single reviewer; keep only latest reply per thread
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3 --reviewer alice --states CHANGES_REQUESTED --tail 1

# Drop outdated threads and include comment node IDs
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3 --not_outdated --include-comment-node-id
```

### Replying to threads

Use the `thread_id` values surfaced in the report when replying.

```sh
gh pr-review comments reply 3 -R owner/repo \
  --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --body "Follow-up addressed in commit abc123"

```

## Threads view

`gh pr-review threads view` provides a grouped, high-level summary of all review threads in a pull request, including their resolution status, file/line context, and reply grouping. This is useful for quickly auditing unresolved feedback, grouping threads by file, or summarizing review activity for LLMs and automation.

**Example:**

```sh
gh pr-review threads view PRRT_XXXXXXX [PRRT_XXXXXXX...]
```

See [skills/references/USAGE.md](skills/references/USAGE.md) for full details.

## Design for LLMs & Automated Agents

`gh-pr-review` is designed to give LLMs and agents the **exact PR review context they need** — without the noisy, multi-step GitHub API workflow.

### Why it's LLM-friendly

- **Replaces multi-call API chains with one command**  
  Instead of calling `list reviews → list thread comments → list comments`,  
  a single `gh pr-review review view` command returns the entire, assembled review structure.

- **Deterministic, stable output**  
  Consistent formatting, stable ordering, and predictable field names make parsing reliable for agents.

- **Compact, meaningful JSON**  
  Only essential fields are returned. Low-signal metadata (URLs, hashes, unused fields) is stripped out to reduce token usage.

- **Pre-joined review threads**  
  Threads come fully reconstructed with inline context — no need for agents to merge comments manually.

- **Server-side filters for token efficiency**  
  Options like `--unresolved` and `--tail` help reduce payload size and keep inputs affordable for LLMs.


> "A good tool definition should define a clear, narrow purpose, return exactly the meaningful context the agent needs, and avoid burdening the model with low-signal intermediate results."


## Using as a Skill

`gh-pr-review` can be used as a reusable skill for AI coding agents via [Vercel's add-skill package](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill).

### Installation as a Skill

To add gh-pr-review as a skill to your AI coding agent:

```sh
npx @vercel/add-skill https://github.com/v2nic/gh-pr-review
```

This command will:
- Install the gh-pr-review extension via `gh extension install`
- Register the skill with your AI agent using the [SKILL.md](skills/gh-pr-review/SKILL.md) definition
- Make all gh-pr-review commands available as skill actions

### What the Skill Provides

Once installed, your AI coding agent can:

- **View PR reviews**: Get complete inline comment threads with file context
- **Reply to comments**: Respond to review feedback programmatically
- **Resolve threads**: Mark discussions as resolved after addressing feedback
- **Create reviews**: Start pending reviews and add inline comments
- **Filter intelligently**: Focus on unresolved, non-outdated comments by specific reviewers

All commands return structured JSON optimized for agent consumption with minimal tokens and maximum context.

### Example Agent Workflow

```
User: "Show me unresolved comments on this PR"
Agent: gh pr-review review view --unresolved --not_outdated
Agent: [Parses JSON, summarizes 3 unresolved threads]

User: "Reply to the comment about error handling"
Agent: gh pr-review comments reply --thread-id PRRT_... --body "Fixed in commit abc123"
Agent: gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id PRRT_...
```
