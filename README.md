# gh-pr-review

A GitHub CLI extension for inline PR review comments and thread inspection in the terminal.

This fork of [agynio/gh-pr-review](https://github.com/agynio/gh-pr-review) adds features for developers, DevOps teams, and AI systems that need complete pull request review context.

**Blog post:** [gh-pr-review: LLM-friendly PR review workflows in your CLI](https://agyn.io/blog/gh-pr-review-cli-agent-workflows)

## Features

GitHub's built-in `gh` tool does not show inline comments, review threads, or thread grouping. This extension adds:

- View inline review threads with file context
- Reply to comments from the terminal
- Resolve threads programmatically
- Group and inspect threads with `threads view`
- Export structured JSON for LLMs and automation
- Manage pull request draft status (mark as draft/ready for review)
- List all draft pull requests in a repository

## Installation

```sh
gh extension install v2nic/gh-pr-review
gh extension upgrade v2nic/gh-pr-review  # Update existing installation
```

### Agent Skill

Register with your AI agent using the [SKILL.md](skills/gh-pr-review/SKILL.md) definition:

```bash
npx skills add v2nic/gh-pr-review

## Usage

Basic workflow:

1. Start a review: `gh pr-review review --start`
2. Add comments: `gh pr-review review --add-comment --review-id <ID> --path <file> --line <N> --body "<msg>"`
3. Submit review: `gh pr-review review --submit --review-id <ID> --event APPROVE`
4. Resolve threads: `gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id <ID>`

### Adding Reactions

Add reactions to any GitHub node (comments, reviews, etc.):

```sh
gh pr-review react <comment_id> --type thumbs_up
```

Valid reaction types: `thumbs_up`, `thumbs_down`, `laugh`, `hooray`, `confused`, `heart`, `rocket`, `eyes`

When inside a git repository, `-R owner/repo` and PR number are inferred automatically.

### Viewing Reviews

`gh pr-review review view` shows all reviews, inline comments, and replies:

```sh
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 3
```

Common filters:

- `--unresolved` — Show only unresolved threads
- `--reviewer <user>` — Filter by reviewer
- `--states APPROVED,CHANGES_REQUESTED` — Filter by review state

Reply to threads using the `thread_id` from the view output:

```sh
gh pr-review comments reply --thread-id <ID> --body "<msg>"
```

### Managing Threads

List and resolve threads:

```sh
# List unresolved threads
gh pr-review threads list --unresolved

# List only your threads
gh pr-review threads list --mine

# Resolve a thread
gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id <ID>

# View full conversation for specific threads
gh pr-review threads view <thread_id> <thread_id>
```

### Managing Draft Status

Check and manage pull request draft status:

```sh
# Check if PR is a draft
gh pr-review draft status --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# Mark PR as draft
gh pr-review draft mark --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# Mark PR as ready for review
gh pr-review draft ready --repo owner/repo --pr 123

# List all draft PRs in repository
gh pr-review draft list --repo owner/repo
```

### Deleting Comments

Delete a comment from a pending review:

```sh
gh pr-review review --delete-comment --comment-id <comment_id>
```

This only works on comments in pending reviews. Once a review is submitted, comments cannot be deleted.

### Awaiting PR Updates

Poll a pull request until it needs attention (new comments, merge conflicts, or CI failures):

```sh
# Check once and exit
gh pr-review await --check-only -R owner/repo 42

# Poll until work detected (default: 1 day timeout, 5 minute interval)
gh pr-review await -R owner/repo 42

# Poll for comments only with custom timeout
gh pr-review await --mode comments --timeout 3600 -R owner/repo 42
```

Exit codes:

- `0` - Work detected (PR needs attention)
- `1` - Error occurred
- `2` - Timed out with no work detected

**Await flags:**

- `--mode <all|comments|conflicts|actions>` - Watch mode (default: all)
- `--timeout <seconds>` - Maximum polling time (default: 86400 = 1 day)
- `--interval <seconds>` - Polling interval (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
- `--debounce <seconds>` - Debounce duration (default: 30)
- `--check-only` - Check once and exit without polling

### Additional Flags

**Review start:**

- `--commit <sha>` - Pin the pending review to a specific commit (defaults to current head)

**Add comment:**

- `--side <LEFT|RIGHT>` - Diff side for inline comment (default: RIGHT)
- `--start-line <n>` - Start line for multi-line comments
- `--start-side <LEFT|RIGHT>` - Start side for multi-line comments

**Comments reply:**

- `--review-id <ID>` - GraphQL review identifier when replying inside a pending review

See [skills/references/USAGE.md](skills/references/USAGE.md) for detailed usage examples.

## Development

Run tests and linters locally with CGO disabled (matching release build):

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...
CGO_ENABLED=0 golangci-lint run
```

Releases use the [`cli/gh-extension-precompile`](https://github.com/cli/gh-extension-precompile) workflow to publish binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
